The three observable trends are:

    1. According to the Latitude vs. Temperature plot, countries with lower latitudes are hotter i.e. higher in Farenheit
    
    2. We observe the highest humidity levels at the Equator which has a latitude of 0 since there is a high concentration of points in the Latitude vs. Humidity scatterplot at Latitude 0.
    
    3. Windspeeds are highest at the higher latitudes as observed in the Latitude vs. Windspeed scatterplot.
