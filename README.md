# WeatherPy

![Equator](Images/equatorsign.png)

In this project, a Python script is created to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, two APIs were utilized:
  * CitiPy, [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), 
  * OpenWeatherMap API, [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), 
  
to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

## Objective 

Build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
